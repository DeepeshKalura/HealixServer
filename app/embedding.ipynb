That, that your dad has moved away, that you're not always in the right clothes and you have to fix some of your meals. And that you're not always feeling loved and special.

Is that it?\"\n",

And I think what you guys are telling me, I mean, we go back and talk about your relationships, in your past relationships, we've often learned that it's very bad idea to be vulnerable. We're talking about that you guys are also in a cultural context where that's not encouraged to be vulnerable.\"\n",
      "\"you've been together for a long time, and so you're Is that what you mean? No, I mean, being gay. That's, yeah, yeah. Yes.  You're even more vulnerable, gay.

      "\n",
      "\"Okay, so I noticed on your diary card that you have that you did cut.\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so let's talk about that a little bit. When what day did that happen on? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tuesday? Okay, so where were you on Tuesday when you first had the thought that you wanted to cut?\"\n",
      "What was going on at your locker?\n",

      "on a scale of one to 10  how angry would you say you were ?\n",

      "\n",
      "What did you do right then? You ride your locker. What's the next thing you did after you heard it?\n",
      "\"So I know that the gym is usually to the place where you cut, because you said you can go behind the bleachers people don't usually see you there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Okay, so we're between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym. Where did you decide to cut? Because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody. There must have been a point where you decided I'm going to cut.\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so that was when you decided to cut. You went down to the gym. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "And what happened when you got there?\n",
      "What did you use to cut ?\n",
      "\n",
      "the same pencil as usual?\n",
      "the the metal tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Okay, that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of.\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so you still have the pencil you got under the bleachers. You say you were feeling angry still. Are you still on the scale of one to 10 where were you when you got under the bleachers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Okay, \"\n",
      "what were you thinking at that point?\n",
      "\n",
      "So you have your pencil Where did you cut ?\n",
      "How many times ?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How deep did you cut where it was a deep enough that you needed a band aid, Did you need more than a band aid?\"\n",
      "But it wasn't so deep that you needed something more?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. Right after you cut Where were you on the scale of one to 10 with your feeling with your anger?\n",
      "\"three, what were you thinking right afterwards?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Did that feeling last you for the rest of the day?\n",
      "\"Okay, so that's what happened right afterwards ? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Later in the day, are we thinking about the cutting?\"\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know night is a really difficult time for you is everything seems worse at night. Yeah. So you were thinking back at a back on it then and you were feeling guilty?\n",
      "Sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last?\n",
      "I knew you've also been working on doing less cutting.\n",
      "\n",
      "you have you've been working really hard. I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings?\n",
      "\"Okay, so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut out your locker. what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Okay, it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day. You said he hadn't called. He hadn't been texting us. And that was on your mind?\"\n",
      "\"So I'm wondering if that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "that'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit.\n",
      "It might not. But it'll bring it down a little bit. Maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more.\n",
      "\n",
      "maybe there'll be things will feel good about later. You won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back.\n",
      "\"So the first thing is that pencil, it sounds like it's comforting to have it. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It also sounds like it's tempting, What do you think about that?\"\n",
      "having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things. When you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less\n",

So you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done and do things for dinner. Suddenly, you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know, that means He needs to go out. And Joe is not going to be home for hours. And you really don't want to take him out. But you have to. And it makes you sick and tired and upset, because you're not going to use the gloves that you always use when you have to take them out. So you walk toward the door, and you think, well, maybe I'll just make them wait. But you realize how wake the baby up if you don't take. So you go toward the leash, and it just makes you even more anxious to see it. And it's dirty. And it's chewed up, and it's gross, and you see stains on it. And you think about what those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you. And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar. And as you go out the door and he lunges outside, he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash, entering your body, through the pores of your skin and you feel like it's just running up your arm through your bloodstream. And you keep thinking oh my god, what if I get sick from this What if What if there's some germs in this or bacteria, but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and bring him back inside the house. Take the leash off. And the urge to wash is so powerful, so strong, you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these terms off from the leash. But you don't do that. You know, to make yourself not do the ritual. And then you go back in then just keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense of feeling sick, is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash. At night you go to sleep, still anxious, still upset about what happened. Wake up in the morning. And then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick, you can feel your body being sick, you rush to the bathroom and vomit You can feel the fever and the time your body is just not not right. You're sick. And you know, it's because you handled that lesion didn't wash, you didn't do the washing you needed to do. And now you're sick and the baby will probably get sick. And if only you had done the washing, okay? What's your level now?\"\n",
      "\n",

And according to my notes, you were going to look into some yoga classes. You were going to attempt to drink less coffee. You were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home, and you were going to spend more time in nature. So I'm wondering how all that went?\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals. You did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes. You did cut down from two cups of coffee to one. And you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk. But it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue. Getting out more with people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it's uncomfortable for you to be To around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking, and how does that make you feel?\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious. So I'm wondering what we could do about that.\"\n",

As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety, doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications. So I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. So how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to 10?\n",
      "\"Good, good. That's a definite improvement. And, and you could determine after that first class, whether your anxiety levels have decreased or not. And that, would that be validation for you? Or would that be? It gives you even more motivation? If your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" Okay. So one other thing that I wanted to, to mention to you was, you said that you'd walk your dog in nature and curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature. Wow.\"\n",
      "\"And so because of it, it was cold and windy. You decided to kind of cut the walk short. Yeah. And and that's definitely understandable. I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day.\"\n",

      "\"Okay, so if you took a jacket in cases cold, yeah. And do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful, that you could be in that would help you even more. Enjoy it\"\n",

      "\"Okay. All right. So it sounds like last week, you had a few problems carrying out the assignments towards decreasing your anxiety. You really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes.

      "\n",
      "you how strongly do you feel about doing them at home?\n",
      "\" And then there would be no embarrassment factor. If you couldn't do the poses less coffee, you've gone from two cups to one cup that's very good. And get out more with people, you've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who's going to be in your space. That's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know you have no control over who's going to be in your space. And on a scale of one to 10 you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog?\"\n",

      "\"What would it What would it mean about you? What would it say about you if you had to take a part time job, so finding another full time job is so much of the loss?\"\n",

Do you agonize you worry, invest in these thoughts? Right? And then to temporarily take away the pain you drink? Yeah. That ends up being more dysfunction, right with a relationship with your husband. Yeah. Imagine if you're intoxicated, you're not looking for new work. Yeah. That wouldn't be ideal timing. So, in a sense, you're, you're not helping things to improve. And it all kind of starts without thinking, \"\n",
      "\"And that ties into that kind of worthless, type five. So you're fulfilling that role. worthless. That sounds manifesting for you. And that's one thing you can do.

      "\n",
      "How do you think you could break that cycle?\n",
      "\"Well, that makes sense. Yeah, so the first step would be figuring out what The minimum amount you really need, right? So you'll shoot for hire full time, but you realize that you kind of need to know what the minimum is because you know what job offer you could accept in which I want free time to decline. Right? So it makes sense. So armed with that information and you could go into the workplace, right? And it was less anxiety kind of just know this Job's gonna if I get it, that's good, right Lord, I might as well not apply to this one because it's not gonna work. So as efficient as time say, it's good. That sounds logical.\"\n",

      "\"Yeah. It would be difficult, right? To be fair, right? It would be difficult, but you would adapt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So if we pick up with that we say that's really an adaptive response when we talk about adaptive responses to automatic thoughts, right? So if you're telling yourself that you have the depression and certainly anxiety, craving to drink, you tell yourself well, the worst that could happen is I don't work the rest of my life again, acknowledging that's pretty unlikely. But the worst thing to happen is I won't work again. And I might have to adapt, I might have to have a simpler life in terms of material goods and small house, but I would survive would affect my battery that have on on your mood, or your thoughts?\"\n",
      "\"So there's a piece that comes with clarity that comes with accepting what the worst case scenario could be. Right? And probably another part of the adaptive response could be, you know, I could live to the worst case scenario. I think it's important to acknowledge that it's unlikely. that's unlikely. Right? So statistics probability is on your side here. Right? So, as you go out to the workplace and the workforce and seek employment, you'll probably have some, some interviews, we don't get a job offers, right. But eventually, if I have one where you do, yeah, right. It's, it's just math. Right? If you can accept the worst case that maybe reduce or limit that alcohol consumption, reduce that depression, anxiety.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So Let's end there for today. But I want you to try for the next week. I want to try plan that adaptive response, right? Actually, there's two we're talking about right? One is you could survive the worst case scenario. And the other one is that probabilistically It won't happen. Right? So you have kind of two. Well, you do have two adaptive responses I want you to apply when those automatic thoughts come up, like, I'm never gonna work again. Okay, this is a catastrophe. So like that self talk. Yeah, apply that self talk. So identify that automatic thought, because we've talked about that skill, right? And then apply that self talk right away. All right, and let's see, you have the thought record. Right. So when that you know, when you can fill one of those out, okay, when that happens when you have that automatic thought and you apply the adaptive response, even if you can't get it completely filled out, I understand that. I know there's a lot on there. Just what you can get done on that. Anything you can do. That would be helpful. \"\n",

In a kind of a direct fashion, like a supervisor coming to, but there's no other evidence supporting it based on your, what you're feeling, how you're perceiving things.

      "\n",
      "What do I mean?\n",
      "\"Right, exactly. So, you know, fears associated with that urge, like you said, to run out the door. So instead of running out the door, we want you to approach the thing that's scary, which is this cheesecake right now. Right? \"\n",

      "\"Okay. So I see how hard it is. For you and I, honestly, it's hard for me to watch and I wish I could just take that away.

      "\"Yeah. So by doing this, hopefully over time, your fear will go down. Okay. So can we have the fear right now And still take a few more bites?\"\n",

Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?\"\n",

      "\"you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event.

So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.\"\n",

      "\"Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.\"\n",
      "Mm hmm. Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance?\n",

At some level, I can accept that. I'm not going to get it all the time. Other other areas of life for you do get respect. \"\n",

So one would be smooth things over and sensitive, discussing this with her, letting her know you're aware what's going on and you want to try to resolve it and the second part would be Trying to move a little bit away from the rigid, you know, I deserve respect to, I would like respect but I'll function adequately without respect from everyone. I know that's tough. That's gonna be that's gonna be the challenge, right? But this will be this will give us good information and give you some practice. Does it all make sense to you?\"\n",

We've talked about exercise department, we've talked about medication not being on the table at this point. But I want you to know, you know, you can call anytime, and I will work to get you in.

And I would say to the reader that you can step back and try to look at the thoughts. I think that you'll see it's it's helpful although I know It's a little difficult or unusual to separate feelings from thoughts sometimes. But I'd like to try to kind of distinguish between the two. Okay. You said that you've been at your job for about five years. You really like your job. So tell me about your job, like kind of how you felt about it, but frame it in a time before this ever happened.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"All right. So you're looking inward, you're looking at yourself a lot of self doubt. Now you're looking at decisions as much more difficult. It's much more difficult to come to the right decision. And second guessing sounds like move to second guessing a bit. When you do make a decision, like playing over over your mind. What could go wrong here? Is that the thought you're having?\"\n",
      "\"Alright, so let's see if we could just talk about the moment of the presentation again. I want to try to help you develop some strategies to bring those anxiety symptoms down. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's actually go right before the moment so you're still in the, you're still sitting down, and you're getting ready to present. Let's just say your second present. Yeah, like we've talked about and you're thinking they're going to seeming as anxious. They're gonna think I don't belong here. These are the right. Okay. So these thoughts occur because you have an expectation rule one add to that you brought into that class, when you walked into that class, you have these expectations already. It's perfectly natural. It's not right or wrong. Everyone has these beliefs. And whenever these beliefs are and we'll talk about that another point, they combined with the stressor of having this presentation in front of you, right, and the classmates watching you, and they result in these thoughts. We call them automatic thoughts, \"\n",
      "\" And just like the beliefs, they're not good or bad. They don't say anything about the person having them. They're just thoughts. Actually, they're fairly understandable and natural thoughts. The problem is that they lead to symptoms. So, you're sitting there at your desk, and you're thinking, they're gonna see that I'm anxious. They're gonna realize I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough, right? What reaction Do you have when you have that far?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "so distressing symptoms.\n",
      "\"What's something that you could send yourself in that moment, that would maybe get in between that thought, and that reaction, so that thought of, I'm not gonna know I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough. And that reaction\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Okay. So some some deep breathing, looking over your notes, like preparing yourself for kind of focusing on that and realizing they're not really looking at you anyway for a moment. Okay, good. Good. Um, you bring your notes with you to class?\"\n",
      "Okay. So You always have those with you.\n",
      "\n",

      "How things been going since the last time we met?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Okay, so there's a few things going on there. You said you feeling stuck? Not happy. And some sound like a little confused as to what's going on what's causing it. You have any suspicions about what might be causing?\"\n",

      "\"something's changed. So for a long time, you were satisfied in housewife, you enjoyed that life or found satisfaction out of life. And somewhere along the line, something changed in you. And now you're not happy with it. So what it represents in terms of activities like caring for your children and shopping? No, that's what changed.\"\n",
      "\"So you're, you're frustrated with your situation, maybe with yourself a little bit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You're not motivated?\n",
      "Have you received any feedback from other people about this meaning? Has anyone else noticed that you're down?\n",

      "they used the word lazy.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What was your response to that? When I said, I need you to more?\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so you're frustrated forfeeling down? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "And you're frustrated for lacking motivation?\n",
      "\"And just as little as a few years ago, you didn't feel it this way at all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Okay, so I'm gonna shift gears a little bit. Can you tell me about your well, a recent day? So it's kind of typical what you're telling me now meaning not motivated down?\"\n",
      "This is you said this was recently right?\n",
      "\n",
      "What would the ideal day of look like take that same day and do you wish you could have done?\n",
      "\"Alright, so it's a fairly wide discrepancy between where you are in terms of behavior and where you want to be. So let me ask you a very specific question about one of the first things in the day you would mention that when it was time to get up. Right? You did. So you were awake and aware of it, but you went back to sleep. And, of course, your husband got up and he took care of things. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you feel alone Not to happen, because clearly that's not what you want to happen. How did you feel about oversleeping?\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so I'm not getting up in the time you wanted you feel guilty, but you also mentioned something that you thought, which was, if I'm not mistaken, you said what's the point, can you expand on that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the point of getting up when sleeping pain at back?\n",
      "\"Okay. But then, when you when you do get up, you feel sad and guilty about having overslept.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So really, functionally, what you're doing is you're delaying experiencing the pain.\"\n",
      "\"And then in terms of how it affects your relationships and your family, you're not getting your kids off to school. Your husband's getting real frustrated. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And all you've really bought yourself is a couple extra hours sleep. And you know, presumably without without pain because you're sleeping, but you're not really escaping it. Does that make sense? \"\n",
      "\"Before when you felt more satisfaction and purpose, did you get up and help the kids off to school?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So maybe what's going on here? Or maybe maybe we could help you remember, you know, over the last few sessions, we've talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and different techniques that I'll be using and different things we're talking about, sometimes with behavior, the behavior that's useful, which in this case, I'm assuming we can agree is the getting up on time. behavior that's useful has to come first, even if the feeling doesn't match. Right. So sleeping those extra I presume you a couple hours delays you from feeling sad, but it causes other problems. If you were to get up one time, you might still feel sad, right? Because that's why you're over sleeping, as you're sleeping longer to avoid that. But the functional part of being a housewife, as you identify would be completed. So maybe some of those feelings of sadness and guilt would over time abate. Because functionally speaking, you're completing the tasks that you want. What's tough about that, So in the moment, it's easy for me to say this now. But in the moment, like for instance, when you have to get out of bed tomorrow, you're going to be facing that same challenge, which is I can get up now and feel depressed, or I can wait and feel depressed later. So in that moment, it's hard to act on the behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards. I mean, it sounds like you want to get up and \"\n",
      "\"Well, it seems like you're, you're more or less making things worse, right? In an effort to avoid the pain that you're going to suffer anyway. You're making the pain worse, and just delaying it a little bit, right. What what thought and we talked before about automatic thoughts, these thoughts that come up when your belief system meets these different situations that occur when you have the thought that this is pointless. Right, and I'm going to expand on my thought a little and say that, you know that thoughts really getting at is I can avoid this pain if I sleep a little while longer. That's a version of the thought.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. So minimizing the benefit.\n",
      "\"So there's a couple of things going on, right? I can avoid the pain by slipping in. And there's really no point to getting out because I won't do any good anyway. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What adaptive response is that self talk, we talked about those things we consciously think to ourselves, could you apply in that moment when you're, you know, whatever time you get up in the morning, when you're thinking about this, that thought comes in that it doesn't really matter if I get up anyway.\"\n",
      "\"Okay. So that would be adaptive response. I'm strong enough. I can get through this, but it will be difficult. Right? How about the value of getting up early and seeing the kids off to school. The automatic thought right now is telling you that's not valuable. But I think that you believe it is valuable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it will seem logical that you have higher probability of getting that back. If you do get up, then if you guess that's true, right? \"\n",
      "she had a zero percent chance of successful successfully moving past this was asleep again and you have some other probability greater than zero if you if you do.\n",
      "\n",
      "That kind of makes sense?\n",
      "\"So even though getting up early is going to be painful and seem like not a practical move. Logically, you know, that has a better chance of paying off for you and I think that with with these type of, what you're going through is probably depression. Right now what I like to talk to you further, to make sure that's what's going on seems like you're depressed, and sometimes with depression, you just have to get one thing going your way each day. Right? So, so I'm not saying necessarily tomorrow, you have to get up one time, and then go make new friends and then go find social activities, right? You don't have to build Rome in a day here. Right? It's, it's more like, Can I do this one thing? Okay, I proved to myself, just what I'm saying, which is I'm strong enough to get up. See the kids often have that one victory for tomorrow. Right and build on that. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And part of that's going to be playing those adaptive responses back, right thinking of those thoughts. Whether it's just thinking them, you know, in your mind or actually thinking them and saying, sometimes it's helpful just to say them out loud,\"\n",
      "\"So you have a good handle on the adaptive responses sounds like right. And you know what you have to say after but you know, what you want to do. I'll see again in a week, and there'll be five days in there between now and my see again, we will have to decide they want to get up as your kids off to school or not, right. So I want you to give that a tryto adaptive responses and try to push through with that behavior. Now it's important to keep in mind that we have five days between now I want to see you again in five business days, right? school days, and you may not succeed every day. And that's okay. Right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes the setbacks like you could, you could get up early two days in a row and then it goes up back up third day, don't let that will wash away those successes. It's a day by day fight, try not to think of it in terms of the week, I want you to try to think of it in terms of what I have to do today. Not worrying about the future, and not worrying about should done in the past. \"\n",
      "\"The only moment we really can live in is now. So try to stay in present the moment recite those adaptive responses, and try to push for that just that one victory. Okay, can you try that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right. So work on that and To continue with the homework, that maybe the CBT homework haven't given you and I'll see you next week. \"\n",

So I'm kind of deliberately not going to a long explanation, the theory and not assigned A lot of homework, the homework is an important part of it. Okay? And one that I feel is in the best interest of clients to really take seriously and make a best effort to do. Okay. So, I'd like that to be one of the, you know, if you're okay with it, that'd be one homework steps, and the other one. So just just be two things for this week. So that self talk in the morning, and the other one was, is really just starting to cultivate an awareness in the day of when you're having these automatic thoughts. So these automatic thoughts proceed. feelings, and behaviors that you don't like, like feeling worried. So they're a little hard to pick up at first, because you're already having the feeling before you even think, to think about the thought, if that makes sense. And there's a few steps But you're already having the feeling of worry. And now I'm asking you to stop in that moment and try to recover the thought that led to that. Yeah. So that's not an easy request, satisfied to starting out with just try to bring up an awareness of that. If you can, I think super helpful, the best way is to write it down, if it's safe to do so. And if you can't, okay. So perhaps sometime today, you find yourself extra worried. And then you think back to what was going through your mind. And you find it was worrying about the welfare of the family, like a thought like, oh, they're not doing so well. Just don't judge the thought. Just write down. I was thinking to the family that might not be doing so well.\"\n",

Do you have any questions about or concerns about today in common we talked about?\"\n",

I know you have worries, and I am working on understanding them with the family and the decision you made and I can certainly appreciate it's it's a struggle for you. At the same time I see somebody very conscientious. No, you're, you're very concerned about the work you do. You're concerned about the people you're act with. compassionate, empathetic. I see a lot of strength in terms of your ability to understand these concepts I'm talking about and apply them in your life. So I want you to take away from this I hope you take away from this, that you should be helpful. I feel like you have a lot of positive characteristics and strengths that you Bring to overcome the struggle, and I think you'll be stronger as a result of working to overcome. Does that resonate with you? How do you think of yourself?\"\n",

They're really effective in preventing these things. And there's also a lot of easy ways to get condoms these days that some people don't know, the local health departments have condoms and many times they're free. And local pharmacies, drug stores have condoms. And there are a lot of clinics that have them as well either for a small fee or sometimes they're actually free. And there's some some ways to that people have found carrying them around pretty conveniently, you know, in their car or in their pockets because they're pretty small. What does it sound like?

      "\n",
      "And she sent you for a blood test.\n",
      "\"Yeah, we think he might be anemic. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What I want to do today was firstly to give you a blood test result. And then talk to you a little bit about the condition of anemia, and then talk about some potential treatments. \"\n",
      "Does that sound okay with you?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Great. So should we have a look at your blood test? Yes. Yeah. Here it is. So what we're testing for is the level of hemoglobin in your blood, right and just to show you the normal range for Women is between 11.5 and 16 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin, right? And this is your level of hemoglobin. It's 8.7. \"\n",
      "\"It's a bit lower than we would like. So what we're looking to do is to get that back within the normal range, right. Just  to reassure you iron deficiency anemia, which I think you've got is fairly common, up to around 15% of women can experience this type of anemia. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's very treatable as well. Yeah.\n",
      "\"I must be, because you've got quite a busy lifestyle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. Yeah. Shall I tell you a bit more about anemia? Do you know anything about the condition?\n",
      "\"It is the condition relates to your blood right. Within your blood there's several components, one of which is plasma. Within the plasma you have your red blood cells. And within that you have a protein called hemoglobin which carries the oxygen around your body to all the different organs. Okay? Now if that's not working efficiently, you start to experience the kind of symptoms that you've been having like breathlessness. dizziness, tiredness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the causes can be blood loss. So I wondered about your periods. How are they?\n",
      "\"Yeah, that may be a fact. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to talk to you about treatments. Now. There are a couple of things that I would suggest that you try. The first thing we'd like to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet. Can you tell me a bit about the sort of diet you have at the moment?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "teenage children they keep you busy.\n",
      "It must be hard for you to do all those things.\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah. Now you mentioned ready meals. I can understand you relying on those for convenience. But the problem is sometimes you don't get the proper balance of nutrients.\n",
      "So what I'd ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich foods in your diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before I tell you about what some of those foods are, can ask if you're a vegetarian.\"\n",
      "\"You know, the reason I asked that is because one of the best sources of iron in your Diet is lean red meat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yeah, exactly. Also liver is a good source of iron. \"\n",
      "What about something like steak that you mentioned? Would you consider eating that a bit more regularly?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's also leafy green vegetables, things like kale and spinach, a good source of iron. \"\n",
      "\"Yes. Yeah, I like broccoli. You know, \"\n",
      "\n",
      "There's other things too. You might want to consider things like fortified cereals which have iron. And\n",
      "\"Well, if you look on the ingredients, panel, cereals, you'll see some are enriched with iron so you could perhaps incorporate some of those. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "could make your life a bit easier.\n",
      "white bread is a good source of iron as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "So do you think you could give some of those things a try?\n",
      "\"right. Yeah, it's the other thing I'd like you to consider is taking a course of iron tablets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. This can be a really effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia. And what it does is it supplements the amount of iron and iron you're getting in your diet.\n",
      "\"yes, yes. Often people respond very well to those. You can have some side effects. Sometimes they can upset your tummy if you have them on, you know, on an empty stomach. So Do you take them after a meal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think those two things adapting your diet and taking a course of iron tablets, I think he might respond very well to treatment. \"\n",
      "how do you feel about the information I've given you so far outside?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Excellent. Yeah, excellent. I've given you quite a lot of information about anemia today. I've got a leaflet here about anemia, which I thought you might like to take home and read in your own time. \"\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's right. So just to check that I've explained things to you correctly, that you could just recap on the the two treatments that you're going to try\"\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, excellent. So what I'd like you to do is come back in a couple of weeks, and then we can see how you're doing. \"\n",
      "Have you got any questions?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think at this stage, when you come back to see me again, we'll do another blood test and check on your hemoglobin level than if you haven't, if it hasn't gone back into the normal range. It might be then that we look at doing some other investigations. But I don't want to worry about that. At this stage. I think let's see how you do with the dietary change in the iron tablets. And we can discuss that next time.\"\n",
      "Is there anything else?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Okay. Well, good to see you. And I'll see you again in a few weeks.\"\n",
      "Bye\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So Tommy I wanted to talk to because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party and you know, you're such a good kid, like, I don't know what you're doing drinking. It's good. ruin your life\"\n",
      "\"I Tommy there's so many consequences with drinking you know you're not even 21 yet you could get arrested. You could you know have a drunk driving accident you could you know, mess up your schoolwork you have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really really concerns me.\"\n",
      "\n",

That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you.
