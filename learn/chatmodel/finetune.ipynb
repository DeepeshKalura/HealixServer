It's a throbbing pain that happens randomly, but it does happen two to three times during the day, which you notice about is if you exert or you extend or flex your elbow at all, that's when it seems to be at its worst. It's gone on for about a week, maybe two, two weeks when you think back on it, and it started out when you were helping your husband clean the garage and you were lifting locks of boxes. So about a six to seven on a pain scale. And you describe it over and over as being a nuisance, which tells me that it's getting kind of in the way of doing some things that you want to you report that it happens probably two to three times a day, and that the pain wraps around the joint. Completely, you've taken some Tylenol for it across the counter, you've taken that several times a day now with without much relief\",\n",

So children will not suffer, they will actually benefit from that agreement, if you two can really, really come to a mutual agreement to what, how we're going to take care of the children. Because the thing no matter how, in my view, no matter how people live together as a couple separate together, the contract life countries, I'm still my father to my children as a mother as much as we could only get that anger out frustration out, we can come to an agreement as to how we're going to work together and even if you don't, they don't live together.

I would like to just say that you mentioned that you you probably would like to escape a little bit from it at the moment. So perhaps I might be able to give you some advice or some some information on you know, some things that you might be able to do to take yourself away from that situation, if you feel as if you know, it's a little bit too much, maybe you might like to tap into your mom or your family and friends as well, if you don't feel comfortable using some of the other services in the area.

So some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends. Some of the things that I would recommend, since you're interested Are you know, carrying around Different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say without any alcohol mixed into it. Often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something.

And based on that sounds like the what, from what you were saying in terms of the assessment process that you have an eating disorder, it's called bulimia nervosa, and I'm not sure if you've ever heard of that.\"},\n",
       " {'text_input': 'I mean, a little bit yeah. Okay.',\n",
       "  'output': \"So what I want to do is kind of describe that for you a little bit. So what you talked about was that there are periods of time when you have when you have eating episodes where you eat, like kind of a large amount of food that you feel like that you've lost control and you feel, you know, like overly full me vomit and the This happens fairly regularly. And there are times to when you, you know, you're maybe really overly concerned about your shape or your weight. And that feel familiar to you. Yeah. So and then it sounds like that's been going on for quite some time, at least, you know, two, three, sometimes even upwards of five times a week.\"},\n",
       " {'text_input': \"I, I'd say, Yeah. All right.\",\n",
       "  'output': \"So just want to let you know to about, about that, that it's not unusual. For a person like in college like yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder like this. In fact, we see upwards of 5% of women and call on college campuses who struggle with that and even more upwards of 20%, who have you know, kind of what we would call kind of variants of that in terms of excessive dieting, and some may even like, throw up or use laxatives or excessively exercise, so it's not unusual. One of the things we know about blaming Nervosa is that for a lot of women, it really starts by Excessive dieting. So like going for long periods of time without eating and sounds like that that was something that you endorsed as well that there are times when you kind of diet excessively. Yeah,\"},\n",
       " {'text_input': 'especially when I was younger.',\n",
       "  'output': \"One of the things that we know about bulimia nervosa is that when people overly restrict or you know, stop eating a lot or go for, you know, a day and a half and really restrict their calories, that oftentimes that that kind of leads into that kind of binge eating cycle. And we know that that's the case. The other thing that we're aware of is that a lot of individuals who struggle with eating difficulties like this also report a lot of difficulties they have like with managing stress or managing relationships or have a difficult time knowing what they're feeling or managing feelings. Is that something that you've experienced? Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, that's okay. Because in many respects, I think both things go on for individuals that struggle with eating difficulties like that. And so we know that there's a lot of dieting and restriction that goes on but we also know that there are other things that are happening in terms of managing feelings, managing stress, etc. So one of the things that I like to focus on in terms of working with clients and working with individuals like yourself is I take an approach it's called interpersonal psychotherapy and, and what that means, in essence is that I like to approach the eating problem by looking at kind of the kind of social in kind of more interpersonal context, because there's a lot of things that are probably going on, or may have gone on in your life that have been kind of associated with times and you've been more likely to use food or to restrict your calorie intake. And so what I'd like to do is really talk with you over the next, you know, few sessions about, you know, periods of time in your life currently and in the past where you've had, you know, overeating episodes and when you've restricted your calories, when you've You know, lost weight, or when you, you know binge and things like that and really start looking at, you know, patterns perhaps in your relationships and then what we'll do is kind of sum that up at the end of the time that we're together and see if we can kind of come up with a little bit of a game plan and some goals to help you reduce your binge eating. So how's that sound? Okay. And there's really good evidence for the things you know, the things that we're going to be doing, in fact, the more that we work on some of these issues, you'll you'll know pretty quickly that you're gonna start feeling a lot better and, and it'll have a, you know, pretty positive impact on your eating. Okay, great. So this is what I'd like to do is first of all, first of all, let's start with I want you to give me a recent episode, where like just recently within the last couple days where you've had one of those episodes that you talked about where you felt like a lot that you lost control, and that you ended up vomiting or you know, and and it will and kind of get an idea about that. And then what I'd like to do is and we'll go kind of back in time, and then I want you to tell me the first time that you had an episode like that. So and then then what we'll do then over the next couple of sessions is then we'll, we'll start from when it started and kind of like work our way up to the present. And I'll just ask you a lot of questions and we'll, you know, kind of go from there. Right? So why don't you tell me the Tell me like a recent episode, that where you felt like that you'd lost control. You're eating\"},\n",

And I just so it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds, I know exactly what you want, we will give you a copy of that to take home. But I find that's not usually enough. What we also do, what I do is I tend to when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor.

And we'll have plenty of time talk about the different structures in CBT. I do want to explain it to you but over the course of several sessions, let's just take pieces of it for now. Okay. So far we believe is that your beliefs combined with a situation and create these thoughts. So you have this belief, so you're laying in bed for work, and you have this belief that you're maybe not competent. And then the situation that combines with that is, it's time to go to work. So the stress of No, it being time to actually get up and get ready to work. And then you have an automatic thought in that moment. Can right now it's one tied to dread and fear. Let's try to identify an exact one for this example. So let's use that scenario. You believe that you might not be confident you're laying in bed, and the alarm clock goes off. So you're kind of pressured to make a decision about do I get ready for work or not? What's the thought right then?\"},\n",

So what we'd like to do when we identify on that felt like that is what's called self talk. And it first this may seem a little odd, right? So you have this thought that comes through it can be an image to the thought image. But it's cognitive in nature. And I can't make a mistake, like, I'm going to make a mistake. I'm going to make a mistake. That's your thought. And the self talk. This is like a rehearsed statement that you literally say to yourself, which again, I get to that seems so odd The first time I do it. So really, you're talking to yourself But over time, we believe if you can keep applying the self talk strategy that you will eventually change the outcome, the reaction and change the underlying belief. Okay? It first though it's going to seem quite foreign to you. Tell me how you how you're processing this now. \"},\n",

So I'm going to make a mistake. That's the automatic thought that's directly leading. Seems to be to feeling supported dread, and physically not getting work on time.

And when you apply that it seems to work. So the message you're kind of sending yourself now you're telling yourself is I'm going to make a mistake still. But if I'm late for work, I'll be worse. So there's a little bit of positive and negative in here. Right self talk doesn't have to be all positive self talk needs to be, I think when anything realistic and sometimes realistic includes a little negativity. I'd rather focus on the more positive elements as we build this as possible though, so that's pretty good self talk you have now let's work on refining it a little bit to maximize its benefit.\"},\n",

But you'd also feel better about the woodworking shop in general that basically what you're saying would Yeah, okay, sure. But as we've talked about in the past, Charles, I know that it still takes steps to get there. Right? That wouldn't change overnight. So I think one useful strategies for you and I to work on a step by step plan that would get us to the place of you being able to drive for hours to see your grandkids.
